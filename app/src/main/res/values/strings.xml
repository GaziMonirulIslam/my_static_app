        CPU:

        The Most important things to consider before buying a laptop is to know about its processor. It has a huge influence on the performance of any laptop.

    </string>

    <string name="laptop_processor_core_i5">

        Intel-core i5: \n\n

        If you are looking for a complete laptop with best combination of price and performance, get one with an intel core i5 CPU. The most common those are ends with ‘U’ like Core i5-7200U. Those are low powered and have the worst performance while the best ones are ‘HQ’ named processor and they have very good performance and mostly used in gaming and workstation systems. Intel’s new 8th gen, ‘Kaby Lake’ CPUs have model number that is like Core i5-8250. They have more amount of cored that improves overall performance boost.


    </string>

    <string name="laptop_processor_core_i7">

        Intel-core i7: \n\n

        A step up from Core i5, which Models with numbers that end in HQ or K use higher wattage and have four cores, allowing for even faster gaming and productivity. There are also Core i7 Y series chips that have lower power and performance. Keep an eye out for CPUs that have an 8 in the model number (ex: Core i7-8250U) because they are part of Intel\s latest, 8th Generation Core Series, and offer better performance. However, 8th Gen processors are only available in the U series right now.


    </string>

    <string name="laptop_processor_core_i3">

        Intel-core i3: \n\n

        Performance is not good that you can do most of the work fine like gaming and editing are possible here. But if you are doing normal stuff like watching YouTube, browsing internet, playing casual games, word document work etc. Don’t expect goof performance with core i3 specially in laptop as they have low cores and thread.



    </string>

    <string name="laptop_processor_ryzen_mobile">

        AMD Ryzen Mobile: \n\n

       A new set of chips designed by AMD to compete with intel’s core i3, i5, i7 processors. AMD Ryzen CPUs are really great price to performance as its cheap and provide nearly equal quality as intel processors. They have more cores and more threads than intel’s one and for that they are good in productivity but not in games like you can stream videos, edit them, do multi-tasking faster than intel’s equivalent at less cost. But gamin is not great on them.


    </string>

    <string name="laptop_processor_pentium_celeron_mobile">

        Pentium/Celeron: \n\n

        Common in sub $400 laptops, these chips offer the slowest performance, but can do if your main tasks are web surfing and light document editing. If you can pay more to get a Core i3 or i5, you\'d be better off.

    </string>

    <string name="laptop_processor_intel_xeon_mobile">

       Intel Xeon: \n\n
Extremely powerful and expensive processors for large mobile workstations. If you do professional-grade engineering, 3D modeling or video editing, you might want a Xeon, but you won\'t get good battery life or a light laptop.


    </string>


    <string name="laptop_ram_guide_intro">

        •What is ram and How does it works?\n\n

        RAM stands for Random Access Memory, and it consists of dynamic memory chips that can be written and rewritten with data very quickly. Unlike your hard drive, however, the memory used for RAM is also volatile, meaning that it only holds onto that data while the chip is powered, so it’s not designed to hold information long term.\n\n

        The bottom line is that RAM is essential to the smooth operating of your computer, particularly for things like multitasking and accessing multiple files at one time. While your overall performance will largely be dictated by the capabilities of your processor and graphics hardware, your memory allotment will directly impact how well you can take advantage of that performance. Too little RAM creates a bottleneck that slows everything down, and the basic rule of thumb is that more RAM is always better.\n\n


    </string>


    <string name="laptop_ram_how_much_need">

Well if you want to know how much ram is enough then there is no straight forward answer as there is lot of things you have to consider and based on your need and budget it will vary a lot. Main things to consider are:\n\n
1. Office productivity\n
2. Web browsing\n
3. Developer\n
4. Photo Editing\n
5. Gaming\n


    </string>


    <string name="laptop_ram_Office_productivity">
        	Office productivity\n\n

Office words are not demanding lots of the times as you would edit word files, create excel sheets, write on documents, open web browsers etc. stuff can be done easily with at least 3-4GB of ram. So, you don’t need that mush of ram if you are eager to buy a laptop just for office works. If you are open lots of apps and works on multiple files then consider at least 6gb of ram or better if possible.\n\n

    </string>


    <string name="laptop_ram_web_browsing">

        	Web Browsing\n\n

        Web browsing is one of the important works all types of people do usually in laptops size devices. So, if you are targeting to buy laptops for normal web browsing and document writing and reading and editing stuff then any normal quality laptop is fine considering they have core-i3 8th gen, 4GB ram combination. This is very basic laptop configuration that can do most of the light works properly like multiple tab opening and browsing and watching videos etc. stuffs. Google chrome takes a lot of ram but 4gb is enough but you have other options like Firefox, Edge, safari etc. too to solve this issue.\n\n


    </string>


    <string name="laptop_ram_developer">

        	Developer\n\n

        Developers job is little bit complex and they need to use lots of apps and software that is very ram consuming and demanding and you need amazing processor, high Ram, SSD, good quality HDD, Good graphics Unit in combined to do complex web design and development specially when building IOS and Android Apps you need to use XCode and Android Studio that consumed huge ram like 8gb at least is a must have to operate properly and 16 GB ram with good SSD is recommended!. They also do tons of web research and photoshop, illustrator works as well so in conclusion I gave to say developer need very good quality laptop with lots of ram.\n\n


    </string>

    <string name="laptop_ram_photo_editing">

        	Photo Editing \n\n

Photo editing is far more demanding than basic office and web functionality. It is a vast field in computer and graphical world. You have Photoshop, Illustrator , Adobe XD etc. types of software that can do photo editing , color grading, cropping, cutting-moving, rotate, multiple layers are there to work on and they are professional apps for logo design, banner design, prototype, graphics design works and they need lots of processor and Ram juice to perform fluidly. You just cannot get good performance in these categories in low level laptops so you must buy a laptop having more than 8GB of ram or if your very tight budget still wants to use those apps then at least 6GB must be needed to do basic editing workflow. But my recommendation will be 8-12GB if you can afford it.\n\n

    </string>

    <string name="laptop_ram_gaming">

        	Gaming \n\n

Gaming is a very important category lots of people buy good laptops for gaming purposes almost everyone knows that gaming need an awesome grade processor like intel’s core-i7 8th gen or core-i5 8th gen or core-i9 based laptops with 16gb or more ram and amazing graphics processing unit and SSD to combine to get better gaming performance as a whole. So, always keep that in minds normal laptops are not for editors and gamers. You have to spends money to get gaming laptops and try to get at least core-i5 with 8GB ram and SSD with 4GB Nvidia or AMD equivalent GPU based laptops.\n\n

    <string name="laptop_storage_guide_intro">

        		Now-a-days there are 2 main options for storage in both laptops and desktops PCs. One of them is HDD and other one is SSD (Solid State Drive). HDD is the main primary storage for many people and SSD is for fast booting stuff and blazing fast speed in read and writing etc.

    </string>

    <string name="laptop_storage_hdd">

        	HDD (Hard Disk Drive): \n\n

        The main storage for holding all media files, audio, video, documents and even lots of people put operating system on them those who can’t afford or use SSDs.\n\n

        The main advantage of using HDD is that it is cheap and most of the laptops has at least 512GB or 1TB HDD. So, you are quite safe to put your media files on those HDDs. But HDDs are slower and cheap they don’t perform as well as SSDs so they are being used only for storage mainly on good laptops. My Recommendation is to buy laptops based on at least 1TB of HDD for holding lots of important files etc. on the go. That is more than enough for laptops. HDD capacity varies from 240GB up-to 2TB in laptops.\n\n

    </string>

    <string name="laptop_storage_ssd">

        	SSD (Solid State Drives) \n\n
Solid state drives are so much popular now as it is almost 10 times faster read and write speed than slow HDDs and it is being used massively in Operation System like holding windows 10 on SSD gives huge performance boost in your laptops and it makes your user experience lot better and smooth. \n\n

         Booting time, games loading time, apps opening times reduced massively by the amazing SSDs and it is so fast but expensive. It is getting cheaper though so don’t worry it is worth the money. It is flash storage and it does not use disk like HDD so it is super-fast and light weight. Thin laptops it too often. Go for at least 128 GB SSDs for better experience but recommended is 256GB but it is expensive too.\n\n

    </string>

    <string name="laptop_storage_ssd_good_side">

        SSD are good for: \n\n
1. Gamers\n
2. Developers\n
3. Editors\n
4. Content creators\n
5. office works.\n\n


    </string>

    <string name="laptop_storage_ssd_bad_side">

        Problems with SSDs:\n\n

1. It is pretty expensive.\n
2. it has lower storage.\n\n


    </string>

    <string name="laptop_storage_ssd_hybrid_drive">

        	Solid State Hybrid Drives:\n\n

        If you want higher performance than a traditional hard drive but do not want to sacrifice storage capacity, a solid state hybrid drive (SSHD) is another option. Some companies are referring to these as just hybrid hard drives.\n\n
        Solid state hybrid drives include a small amount of solid state memory on a traditional hard drive that is used to cache frequently used files. They do help speed up tasks such as booting up a laptop but they are not always faster.\n\n




    </string>

    <string name="laptop_storage_smart_response_technology_ssd_cache">

        	Smart Response Technology and SSD Cache \n\n

        Similar to hybrid hard drives, some laptops are using both traditional hard drives with a small solid state drive. The most common form of this uses the Intel Smart Response Technology. This provides the benefits of the storage capacities of the hard drive while gaining the speed benefits of a solid-state drive.\n\n

    </string>


    <string name="laptop_storage_ssd_hdd_combination">

        	SSD and HDD combination:\n\n

        Always try to buy laptops having SSD and HDD and 2 different purpose one is for OS and apps installing and another is media files storage to get optimal performance from your laptop.\n\n

This port comes with 20-pin connector and also sends video and audio signals to external display devices like monitors. There are mainly 2 types of Display ports on modern laptops like standard display port and mini display port.\n\n

 You would find mini Display ports mostly on small and thin sized laptops like Microsoft Surface Pro tablets and Apple’s MacBook Pro laptops. Standard Display ports are found on bigger sized laptops.\n\n

    </string>


    <string name="laptop_ports_type_thunder_bolt_3">

        ThunderBolt 3\n\n
ThunderBolt 3 is very identical to USB-C port but they operate on different protocols. Basically, the thunderbolt 3 is a USB-C port that support higher and faster transfer speed of up to 40 Gbps, four times that of regular USB-C Gen 2.\n\n
        Also, all ThunderBolt 3 ports can function as USB-C but it is more than USB-C port. It is rarely found on average quality laptops only good quality high end laptops has that feature ports that can get you amazing performance by adding external GPU power to your laptops to increase gaming and rendering performance on your laptops. So, before buying expensive laptops must check if it has this useful port. You can identify it by seeing a thunder-like inscription next to it.\n\n

The RJ-45 port has an 8 pin – 8 contact (8P – 8C) connector and sometimes comes with two LED lights indicating packet detection and transmission. It is very common and important to have if you use internet a lot with ethernet broadband ports etc.


    </string>


    <string name="laptop_platform_intro">

        Pick a platform: Windows, Mac, Chrome OS\n\n
There is no direct answer what you should get it depends on which side you will be benefited from your kind of work and you must choose platform according to your need and workbench. Windows, Mac, Chrome all have differences in features, benefit and optimization with mixed user experiences.\n\n


    </string>


    <string name="laptop_platform_windows_10">

        	Windows\n\n
The most common and flexible operating system. Windows appears on most laptops, notebooks as it fits very well in tablet mode and laptop mode with good office related workflow, and amazing gaming performance as well. If you want to buy laptops for productivity, office work, gaming and game developing then it is always better choice and more optimized choice for most of the people. Windows 10 based laptops are in both tablet and full-sized laptop modes so it is great advantage.


    </string>


    <string name="laptop_platform_mac_os">

        	Mac OS\n\n

        All Apple\’s MacBooks come with latest desktop operating system macOS Mojave. It is full and complete OS platform that do every type of works very nicely except gaming. It is great for Android, IOS, Web development and overall programming is a joy on Mac OS platform. Terminal workflow is amazing on this platform. Video editing, programming, development, productivity, office work, photo editing all types of work just flow on Mac OS and it is that good optimized top of the line OS for laptops. But you will not find portable tablets with both full-sized laptops in it like windows laptops.\n\n

    </string>


    <string name="laptop_platform_chrome_os">

        	Chrome OS\n\n

Found on inexpensive ChromeBooks such as the Samsung ChromeBook 3. Google\'s OS is simple and secure, but more limited than Windows or macOS. The user interface looks a lot like Windows with an application menu, a desktop and the ability to drag windows around, but the main app you use is the Chrome browser. The downside is that many of the "web apps" you use don\'t work particularly well offline. However, that\'s changing as a several ChromeBooks, including the high-end, Google PixelBook, can now run Android apps.\n\n


    </string>

    <string name="laptop_display_and_graphics_intro">

        Laptops Display:\n\n

There are tons of things to know about Display in a laptop buying guide specially screen size, Display quality, resolution, color reproduction, black level, screen types, color gamut, contrast, brightness, v-sync, g-sync etc. are so vital to know for buying good quality laptops. Let’s understand then in details.\n\n


    </string>


    <string name="laptop_display_and_graphics_topics">

        Topics to know\n\n


        	Resolution\n
	Contrast\n
	Brightness\n
	Color gamut\n
	IPS, LCD, OLED\n
	HDR\n
	Refresh rate\n
	G-sync\n\n


    </string>


    <string name="laptop_display_and_graphics_resolution">

        	Resolution\n\n
It is one of the most common feature people care about more and more as there is a trend going how good and sharp your display like having full HD 1080P (1920*1080) and QHD (2560*1440P) panel and some 4k (3820*2160) display notebooks and laptops are in the market. Companies do market lot on display panel and resolution is also main reason people really do care about display of laptops and I think it is very important to know the benefits as more the resolution the more pixel in one inch and better and sharper image quality. Density is the key point here. One curse is that the more your pixel is the less battery life you will get as it is power hungry. There are cheap 720P (1366*768) panels are out there so be careful on that those are not sharp and produce bad image and video quality which is never a good thing.\n\n


    </string>


    <string name="laptop_display_and_graphics_contrast">

        	Contrast\n\n
Contrast ratio is simply the ratio of luminance between brightest color (white) and darkest (black) color on a display. Higher ratios are considered better because it means images will appear more defined and realistic. Experts have tested some best laptops having highest points on contrast ratio are Dell XPS 13, MacBook and Surface lines product. It is always a matter to look for good quality display. It is stated as 100000:1 as example.\n\n


    </string>


    <string name="laptop_display_and_graphics_brightness">

        	Brightness\n\n
Brightness is important for mobile devices like laptops, smartphone and tablets. Most devices have a glossy display to enhance contrast but glossy makes reflection an issue in bright rooms or outdoor. These reflections can only be defeated by a bright display.\n\n
        The Nit is the standard unit to measure how bright the display is and how good is outdoor visibility. A higher rating means a brighter display. On an average laptops and mobile devices are usually between 200 and 300. A rating over 300 is good and above 500 is extremely good. Only a few laptops put out that much light. So before buying check how good is the brightness level to see content in outdoor properly.\n\n



    </string>


    <string name="laptop_display_and_graphics_color_gamut">

        	Color Gamut\n\n
Microsoft and HP collaborated in 1996 to create a standard color space as sRGB. A color space is a standard gamut of colors that displays should be capable of reproducing.\n\n

        In color gamut, the squares represent the colors the screen should display and the circle represent our color measurements. The lighter colored triangle represents the full range of colors that the display should be able to produce.\n\n

        These days, most laptops you purchase can handle most of the sRGB color space. Even most midrange IPS displays can handle around 90 percent or better. So, today’s standards we often use color gamut using Adobe RGB color space. Only the highest quality laptops handle over three quarters of this color space.\n
Only some professional laptops like MacBook Pro, ThinkPad X1 Extreme and dell XPS 15 can reach 90s of both sRGB and Adobe RGB.

    </string>


    <string name="laptop_display_and_graphics_hdr">

        HDR (High Dynamic Range)\n\n
HDR is not so new thing now in 2019 specially in laptops and monitors, smartphones etc. But you will find those HDR quality display in high-end Laptops only. It is not difficult to understand what is HDR, it is just a technology that allows for high level of contrast between light and dark images on a screen and for better color depth in images and videos in general.\n\n

        Some good quality video purpose and gaming centric laptop comes with that HDR display. You can see movies and games more bright, vibrant and fun to watch or play. A laptop like 3rd gen ThinkPad X1 Yoga comes with HDR supported display as an example.\n\n

    </string>


    <string name="laptop_display_and_graphics_refresh_rate">

        Refresh rate\n\n
Measured in hertz, a refresh rate is a term which explains how often a display can change the picture in a second. Common refresh rates include 60Hz, 120Hz, and 144Hz, but these have nothing to do with color accuracy or resolution. Still, for gaming, refresh rates are especially important.\n\n
        Playing games at a native refresh rate on a monitor or laptop is best since it can avoid screen tearing, where the video card is pushing out frames that a display cannot support. More and more video cards like the Nvidia GTX 1080 or RTX 2080 can power frame rates over 60Hz, so it is an investment in a monitor or laptop with a high refresh rate ensures the best possible experience. As most gamers can attest, the difference between playing a fast-paced shooter on a 144Hz screen versus a 60Hz screen is, quite literally, game-changing.\n\n
        While high-refresh rate displays are only now beginning to appear in gaming laptops, we would recommend the Alienware 17 R5, which supports refresh rates up to 120Hz — or even the Razer Blade 15, which goes up to 144Hz.\n\n



    </string>


    <string name="laptop_display_and_graphics_screen_types">


        Screen types\n\n

        Screen Types are generally LCD, IPS, OLED in laptops. Each panel has its own advantage and disadvantages along with good sides as well. Let’s understand in details.\n\n



    </string>


    <string name="laptop_display_and_graphics_lcd">

        LCD\n\n
There are two basic technologies that are used in LCD panels laptops those are TN and IPS (In Place Switching). TN panels are most common but they are cheap and good for budget category laptops to reduce some price. TN panels has the worst viewing angles and display quality with poor black level and color reproduction. Only good thing is that it offers faster refresh rate which makes it better for gamers who play lots of compitative games at very high frame rates.\n\n
        Not for content creator, photo and video editors, graphics designers in general but good for gamers and normal budget buyers.\n\n



    </string>


    <string name="laptop_display_and_graphics_ips">

        IPS\n\n
IPS panels are used in good quality laptops more often as it provides amazing 178 degree viewing angles that we can watch content with friends and family without any distortion or negative effect in screen. It has much better color reproduction and more accuracy in color gamut result and better for any types of users like video editors, photo editors, movie watching and those who need accurate color in their work. Always try to get laptops with IPS panel but it will be little expensive option but it is worthy to spend to buy good panel.\n\n


    </string>

    <string name="laptop_display_and_graphics_oled">

        OLED\n\n
OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) is another amazing display panel tech that is showing up in some laptops and smartphones but only high-end ones has OLED panels and it is expensive and produce very rich deep color and superior black level that enhances your visual experience over other LCD and IPS panel. OLED has deep black level as there is no backlight on it but LCD has backlit so OLED is far better than LCD and IPS in terms of black level and great color reproduction.\n\n
        OLED also has problems and it is like if you watch or play games longer period you will feel that screen burning issues a lot after long uses. It is very expensive and only few laptops are there that has OLED displays. It is not that good for gamers as low refresh rate hurts gaming experience a lot. It is only limited to 60HZ but LCD can go over 200HZ so there is massive difference there. So, buy according to your need.\n\n


    </string>

    <string name="laptop_display_and_graphics_gsync_intro">

        G-sync\n\n
        It is Nvidia tech launched in 2013 that is used on display technology both in monitors and laptops of high-end models. It helps to increase performance with a focus on reducing input lag and eliminating screen tearing. If you are a gamer and buying a laptop for amazing gaming experience this part is for you.\n\n


    </string>

    <string name="laptop_display_and_graphics_screen_tearing">

        Screen tearing?\n\n
Sometimes when you have low refresh rate monitors on a laptops like 60HZ then you have a good graphics processors that can handle games over 60FPS then you will see your monitor is tearing some part during the gameplay which is not ideal at all and it is pretty disgusting that your screen is not able to catch up with the speed of gameplay frame rates it will cause screen to tear to catch up the speed. V-sync allows to reduce gameplay to locked 60 FPS to match the refresh rate with gameplay speed to produce tear free performance.\n\n
But with v-sync enabled your gaming performance will be really bad as it is causing performance hit on your resources. If you can play at high frame rate you will feel and perform better in competitive games.\n\n


    </string>


    <string name="laptop_display_and_graphics_gsync_advantage">

        Why G-Sync is better?\n\n
Because monitors have a fixed refresh period and graphics cards have inconsistent output based on the image they\'re rendering, problems arise when graphics cards output too quickly or too slowly to the monitor. G-Sync changes the monitor\'s refresh rate so that it works best with what the graphics card is delivering, including making real-time predictions of the graphics card output based on recent performance.\n\n
G-sync is found on high quality gaming laptops like Alienware, Asus ROG, Acer gaming series laptops etc. but you will feel the difference in gaming with those laptops.\n\n


    </string>


    <string name="laptop_screen_size_intro">
        Screen Size: \n\n

        When it comes to laptops, size matters. You need to pick a size that’s the right fit for you. Size cannot be upgraded like ram or HDD, so choose it carefully.\n\n
        Laptop sizes tend to start at 11.6 inches and go all the way up to 17.3 inches. Most modern brand like HP, Dell, Asus, Acer offers 13.3 inches, 15 inches, 17 inches laptops.
        If portability is your priority, you will go for smaller sized windows laptop. They are slim, thin and light one. A laptop with 12.5 or 13.3 inches have an weight of 1 kg and 1.5kgs But there will be less ports in small sized laptops.\n\n
        Keep in mind that smaller sized 13.3 inches machines often don’t support high-end CPU and discrete GPU to power up the machines that much. You will find high-end specs in bigger sized laptops. Convertibles(2-in-1) laptops can expand it by folding away the keyboard and can be used as table mode without keyboard such as Acer ChromeBook.\n\n

    <string name="laptop_screen_size_11_to_12_inch">

        11 to 12 inches:\n\n
        The thinnest and lightest systems around have 11-to-12-inch screens and typically weight 2.5 to 3.5 pounds.Generally used when travelling and doing very light works like documents reading, taking notes, web surfing, watching youtube on the fly not more than that!\n\n

    <string name="laptop_screen_size_13_to_14_inch">
        13 to 14 inches:\n\n
        Provides the best balance of portability and usability. Particularly if you get a laptop that weights under 4 pounds. It is an amazing choice for students and for business persons who carry laptops a lot and doing their daily works. It is more suitable to medium and light workload. Battery life is great on thin and small laptops as it has less powerful machines and small screen.\n\n


    </string>

    <string name="laptop_screen_size_15_inch">

        15 inches:\n\n
        The most popular size, consider this size if you want a larger screen and if you are not planning to carry your notebook too often. Most of the people don’t like to carry big laptops but it is great combination of power and weight and that’s why you will get lots of laptops in 15 inch as this size is suitable and powerful both. gamers can use it too as their main gaming setup as well who don’t use desktop so much. This is the most recommended size for laptops.\n\n


    </string>

    <string name="laptop_screen_size_17_inch">

        17+ inches:\n\n

        If your laptop stays on your desk most of the time a 17 to 18 inches laptop could provide you with great processing power and for doing gaming and workstation level of work etc. It is definitely not for average consumer who travels, go outside with it regularly or business persons etc. But it is more proper for mainstream laptops with very powerful core i9 based processor, top of the line GPU with bulky size and good ventilation for cooling stuff makes the laptops very hard to carry and do normal works. The battery life on these huge laptops are worst in most brands as it has huge screen with very powerful resources.\n\n

        Processor is the brain of every smartphones. It is the primary component that defines how well the performance would be on your smartphone. There are so many components and things are interconnected with the processor like GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Camera, Display and battery performance and optimization all depends on the quality of processor. So, being able to choose good processor is a good sign of smart buy.\n\n

    </string>

    <string name="smartphone_processor_cores_and_clock">


        Smartphone cores and clock speed:\n\n
As usual is measure by clock speed and numbers of core it has like more the cores like 8 cores is better performer than 4 cores and clock speed is measured how many cycles it can rotate in 1 sec. The more clock speed the better and more power hungry It will be for example 2.8Ghz processor is more powerful than 2.2 but more battery consuming as well. The higher core means you can do more works simultaneously with more recent apps in background and do multitask very efficiently in higher core smartphone processors.\n\n
        A core is a processing unit within a CPU. Each one can handle tasks independently and they can be combined to provide more power to particularly intensive tasks.\n\n
        In normal use, a multi-core processor will see the cores share the workload of the OS and all your running apps without ever reaching their maximum clock speed. The result is a snappier, more responsive device, with better multitasking support, plus lower heat emission and less power consumption.\n\n

        Good Processor With Good GPU:\n\n

        The good quality CPU smartphones comes with a good GPU in package. So, it is an expensive bundle like top of the line Snapdragon 845 comes with adreno 630 GPU and Snapdragon 855 comes with adreno 640 GPUs. So, we can see there should be good quality processor matched with higher end GPUs to produce optimal performance. It is also an expensive solution. Similarly, a midrange snapdragon 636 comes with adreno 509 which is a midrange level graphics unit for budget users. GPU is very important for gamers and visual works like editing, rendering and most importantly playing modern HD games at decent frame rates.

        Camera Department:\n\n
        Every Smartphone has a camera and it is one of the most important selling point of many smartphones. Even some smartphone users buy it only seeing the features of camera department. But sometime they do not know the proper basic things that should be concerned with when buying it for only camera reason. It is all about good quality hardware used in camera and the sensor used in it and how large the sensor is and how good it is in HDR and how good is it in low light scene and how good the video quality and how many FPS it can shoot video etc.\n\n


    </string>

    <string name="smartphone_camera_sensor_size">

        Sensor Size:\n\n
The bigger the sensor, the more it can see and the better the photos it should take. The size of a typical smartphone sensor is around one-third of an inch, but, in some phones, the sensor can be as big as an inch. The bigger the sensor the bigger the pixels, so in theory at least if you have two phones with the same megapixel count but one has a bigger sensor, that one will produce the better shots. If you have 12 MP camera with smaller sensor and 10 MP with bigger sensor size than 10 MP will give much better photos.\n\n



    </string>


    <string name="smartphone_camera_aperture">

        Aperture:\n\n
Aperture is how much light a lens lets in, and it’s expressed in f-stops: f/2.0, f/2.8 and so on. The smaller the number the bigger the aperture and the more light gets in, so if you want really great low-light performance without a flash, for example, you want the lowest aperture you can. Smaller aperture numbers also indicate that you will get interesting depth of field effects, also known as bokeh effect where the foreground is clear but the background is blurry.\n\n



    </string>


    <string name="smartphone_camera_image_stabilization">

        Image Stabilization:\n\n

Image Stabilization is a great technology to have in smartphone camera arena as It helps to take shake free image and make it more cleaner looking image. Specially in low light photography when take image it comes out blurry so in that case image stabilization helps a lot taking better photos in low light.\n\n
        There are basically 2 types of image stabilization one is Digital image stabilization that uses software to compensate for slight shakes and to keep the image stable and the other one is optical image stabilization which uses mechanical means to keep the lens still.\n\n
        Optical is usually better than digital stabilization, especially in low light. Unless the software is really, really good and it often it cannot compete with the shake-free footage you get from a lens that moves when the camera does.\n\n



    </string>


    <string name="smartphone_camera_hdr">

        HDR (High Dynamic Range):\n\n

        HDR, as its name implies, is a method that aims to add more dynamic range to photographs, where dynamic range is the ratio of light to dark in a photograph. Instead of just taking one photo, HDR uses three photos, taken at different exposures. You can then use image editing software to put those three images together and highlight the best parts of each photo. In the case of HDR on smartphones, your phone does all the work for you just snap your picture and it will spit out one regular photo and one HDR photo. The result is something that should look more like what your eyes see rather than what your camera sees.\n\n


    </string>


    <string name="smartphone_camera_iso_and_shutter_speed">

        ISO and Shutter speed:\n\n

Shutter speed is how long the camera keeps the lens open to take a picture, and ISO is how sensitive your camera is to the available light. Many camera apps allow you to adjust both of these things.\n\n
        The bigger the ISO number the more sensitive your camera is to light, so for example, if you are shooting at ISO 100 the camera needs one second to capture the image, while at ISO 800 it only needs 0.125 seconds. That extra sensitivity comes at a cost, though, and that is noise, if you are shooting at really high ISOs you will see a lot of noise, which manifests itself as a grainy effect.\n\n



    </string>


    <string name="smartphone_camera_4k_recording">

        4K Recording:\n\n
Now with the advancement of smartphone processor now in first segment of 2019 almost all midrange and high range smartphone support 4k recording in rear camera so before you buy must check if it has that feature or not but I can tell you this feature is present in almost any phones now. 4K is just a resolution than is 4 time than 1080p that in 1920 by 1080 pixels and 4k is 3840 by 2160 pixels. It captures very high quality videos and you can watch it in 4k Tv even and they will look crisp in bigger TVs as well. So, this is a must feature to have now. If you buy higher end devices you get the smoother 4k 60 FPS video option which is so smooth. So, if you need it must check if the phone has it or not.\n\n



    </string>


    <string name="smartphone_camera_eis">

        EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization):\n\n
This is an called as EIS because it helps to stabilize videos that looks good to our eyes and for vlogging and making taking good videos it is a must have features to have. EIS down this by using software that handles the shakiness and adjust videos with the video movement. But this is not the best solution there is OIS there which is better than this.\n\n




    </string>


    <string name="smartphone_camera_ois">

        OIS (Optical Image Stabilization):\n\n
OIS is the better Video Stabilization technique that has a mechanism to move sensor with the camera movement so in higher end devices you will see this like Pixel 3XL, Galaxy Note N9, iphone XS max etc. all have these types of IOS in video mode to make video more shake free and smoother.\n\n



    </string>

    <string name="smartphone_camera_slow_motion">

        Slow-motion:\n\n
Most of the phone already have it but the difference is in FPS (Frames Per Seconds) . As the higher the frame rate is the more fluid your slow-motion will be and it will look more immersive to watch. As this is a nice feature almost all midrange phones have like 720p 120 fps slow-motion facility and some have even 1080p 120 or 240 fps slow-motion. Some higher end have 1080p 480 fps which is rare to find and some have 720p 980fps ultra slow-motion feature. But for those you have to spent a lot of money. So just see and differentiate what you need and how good quality you want in it. Always remember the good quality processor can handle high FPS videos like over 240FPS slow-motion or better such as 480 FPS etc.\n\n



    </string>

    <string name="smartphone_camera_final_verdict">

        Final Verdict:\n\n
I have talked about the most important things to consider before buying the smartphone for camera department and all those features I talked here is so vital for knowing about smartphone camera like IOS, EIS, Sensors, Aperture, Mega Pixel, image processing, good quality sensors are so important to know before buying any smartphones.

    <string name="smartphone_display_intro">
        Display is Important!\n\n

        When using any smartphone, you will first notice the display and this display quality defines a lot about the smartphone brands, price, display panel used, resolution used in it and so on. So, knowing about the display of a smartphone is so vital is buying any phone.\n\n


    </string>

    <string name="smartphone_display_resolution">
        Resolution:\n\n
There are mainly 4 types of display resolution in smartphone arena like 720p HD that is 1280 by 720 pixels,  Full HD 1080P which is 1920 by 1080 pixels, QHD 1440p (Quad HD) that is 2560 by 1440 pixels and finally 4K which is UHD (Ultra HD) 2160P display resolution is 3840 by 2160 pixels and now most of the smartphone is 2018 and 2019 are with at least 720p and 1080p for budget segment and premium smartphone comes with normally 1440p display but 4k display phone is rarely found, one of them is Sony Xperia ZV premium.\n\n
        4K is 4 times of 1080p full HD, 2K is 2 time of 1080p Full HD, so you can imagine how many pixels are there in 1 inch of display nearly 500 PPI (pixels per inch) per inch and that makes a smartphone display so crisp and clear to look. Movies, Games, reading text files are joy in those high-resolution display.\n\n
        Now for lower end segment like 720P and 1080p are come with nearly come with PPI of around 200 pixels per inch and 400 pixels per inch. Also, this depends on Screen Size of smartphone too. Smaller display with 1080p resolution means more crisper and sharper display than bigger display 1080p display. Always check which one is best for you now as I told you all the basics of different display resolution used in it. And it also depends on your budget and need too.\n\n



    </string>


    <string name="smartphone_display_resolution_and_processor_optimization">

        Resolution and Processor Optimization:\n\n

As you all know by now the more the resolution the more pixels are in it and the sharper and crisper the content will look on your smartphone. But Some time lots of brands use higher resolution display which is good but they give low quality processor that cannot handle the GPU and that high resolution display so performance drops dramatically , which we do not want specially you want a decent phone you must not want poor performance and slow user interface so keep in mind that with processor the display resolution should also be matched properly like if you have 1440P display suppose and the processor is midrange like Snapdragon 450 or 625 then you will not get the optimal performance from it. Because those CPU are not designed to be used in so much higher resolution display. If the display is 720P or at most 1080p then it is fine. For high resolution display you need high quality processor to give juice that much.\n\n

    <string name="smartphone_display_panel_types">

        Panel Types:\n\n
Display Panels are one of the important things to consider when choosing the best phone for you guys. I will first talk a little bit about different types of panel then my recommendation will be done. There are basically 4 types of display is smartphones:\n\n

a. TFT-LCD\n
b. IPS\n
c. OLED(AMOLED)\n
d. Retina\n\n


    </string>


    <string name="smartphone_display_tft_lcd">
        TFT-LCD:\n\n

LCD (Liquid Crystal Display):\n\n
        An LCD is a flat-panel display that is based on the light-modulating properties of liquid crystals. Although LCDs are very thin, they are composed of several layers. Those layers include two polarized panels with a liquid crystal solution between them  light is projected through the layer of liquid crystals and is colorized, which produces the visible image.\n\n
        The important thing to note is that the liquid crystals do not emit light themselves, so LCDs require a backlight. They are thin, light and generally inexpensive to produce, and the most mature display technology used in smartphones.\n\n
        Some of the advantages of LCDs include high brightness, consistent color fidelity at different viewing angles, better color sharpness thanks to the use of an RGB matrix, and longevity (LCDs are not susceptible to burn in, though they can suffer temporary image retention). They also tend to exhibit lower contrast and inferior response times compared to some AMOLED equivalents.\n\n



    </string>


    <string name="smartphone_display_ips">

        IPS (In-Plane Switching):\n\n

In-plane switching involves arranging and switching the orientation of molecules of the liquid crystal layer between the glass substrates of the display. Simply put, it’s a technology that is used to improve viewing angles and color reproduction on TFT displays, and that is intended as a replacement for TN (Twisted Nematic) displays.\n\n
        It is used on LCDs to get up to 178 degree horizontal and vertical viewing angles. So, if you need good quality display at great 178 degree viewing angles you must select an IPS panel display. TFT LCD is not used in even mid ranged devices in 2019 and late 2018. IPS becomes the most affordable and better display.\n\n

    <string name="smartphone_display_oled">

        OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode):\n\n

OLED, unlike LCD, does not require a backlight, because the pixels contain light-emitting diodes that power on and switch off on an individual basis. The advantages of OLED displays include a theoretically infinite contrast ratio, and also a wider native color gamut, a lesser shift in brightness at different viewing angles, and better power efficiency with low APLs. The downsides include color shifting at different viewing angles, burn-in, and lower power efficiency in high APL applications.\n\n

    <string name="smartphone_display_retina">

        Retina Display:\n\n
Retina display is made by apple and they call it retina as it has around 326 or above PPI (pixels per inch) which is not possible for human to detect a single pixel easily. It means I will be sharp and crisp to look and they optimize it so perfectly that the color reproduction is also so good as well as viewing angles are quite decent. But recently there are more sharper displays are coming from different brands with over 500 PPI which is crazy sharp to look at.



    </string>


    <string name="smartphone_display_hdr_support">

        HDR Support:\n\n

HDR, or high dynamic range, is a display feature in some newer devices and future flagships that promises a more lifelike media-viewing experience. Here’s the simple explanation: HDR-capable displays have a high peak brightness, giving scenes more detailed shadows without sacrificing detail in highlights. On top of that, they can display wider color ranges and richer color depths, leading to a higher number of colors with more steps in each color gradient.\n\n
        This is because HDR displays support wide color gamuts (DCI-P3 is currently the most widely supported wide color gamut), and also support 10-bit color.This theoretically allows HDR-enabled smartphones to display over 1 billion colors. As of now, flagship smartphones are starting to support the HDR10 and Dolby Vision standards.\n\n



    </string>


    <string name="smartphone_display_contrast_ratio">

        Contrast Ratio:\n\n

This is the ratio of a display is peak brightness to its black level. OLED displays have a theoretically infinite contrast ratio because the pixels can be completely switched off, though in practice, ambient light prevents this from being realized except in a completely dark room. Thus, OLED panels can improve their contrast ratio by reducing screen reflectance.\n\n



    </string>

    <string name="smartphone_display_verdict">

        Recommendation:\n\n

Based on your choice for you budget you should get at least and IPS display with 1080p display that is quite decent for almost every task like movie watching, gaming, reading pdf and documents and browsing internet with crisp text is not an issue but remind that processor should also be decent like Snapdragon 636,660,710,exynos 7 series and 9 series with octa core, kirin  970, 710 etc. and for higher end go for 1440p with Snapdragon 845,855, Kirin 980,exynos 9 latest series etc. are best one to support 1440p display.  And for Viewing angles just IPS is good enough and if you want better color and contrast you can go for higher end OLED display that is simply the best choice.

    <string name="smartphone_battery_intro">

        Battery:\n\n
Battery is one of the most important factors for many people in case of buying any smartphone. As a smartphone user you might be using for long time so keeping the battery juice is so much important before buying and electronics product. Here I will give you some basic idea about battery and types and which is good and which one you should look for buying.\n\n


    </string>


    <string name="smartphone_battery_types">
        Types of cellphone batteries:\n\n
a. Nickel-cadmium (NiCd)\n
b. NiMH (NiMH)\n
c. Lithium-ion (Li-ion)\n
d. Lithium Polymer (Li-Pol)\n\n

        But now the Ni-Cd and NiMH batteries are not used anymore in smartphones as more advanced Li-Ion is here to fit into mobile industry. And the latest one is here is Lithium-polymer battery which also being used in some recent devices.\n\n



    </string>

    <string name="smartphone_battery_capacity">

        Battery Capacity:\n\n

A battery capacity is a measure that indicates how much electricity this battery can give for some time. It is measured in milliampere-hours (MAh).\n\n
        A larger one will provide you more battery capacity and it will last longer but It will take more time to recharge itself. Always you should choose the battery capacity based on your uses and how intense work you do on it. If you want to use it for much longer than you have to go for more MAh battery.\n\n
        The more the feature the more you will use it and we use our smartphone for so many reason like taking videos, photos, browsing internet, playing online games etc. suck up tons of juice from battery.\n\n


    </string>


    <string name="smartphone_battery_and_processor_optimization">

        Battery and Processor:\n\n

There is a relationship between good battery like and good quality and power efficient processor and how much well the processor is like more recent version is always has better architecture and it has like 14nm process or better like 7 nm or 12 nm based on its price and specification, 7 nm is not very common to find only the best smartphones comes with it and it is very power efficient and more optimized for longer uses. 14 nm is mostly available in the market that you will find but do not buy that has 28 nm process which is bad in 2019. Go for at least 14nm or close to 7 nm based on your budget. This will give you better performance as well as good battery life.\n\n




    </string>


    <string name="smartphone_battery_verdict">

        Battery Recommendation:\n\n

My recommendation for buying smartphone for optimal performance is first check the processor used in it. Normally I have seen Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 series and 800 series has very good quality battery efficiency and also the latest Samsung exynos has good battery life but in recent version like 7 and 9 series exynos are good, you will also find Huawei kirin processor that come with latest 7 nm process and midrange have 14nm process too. But I used a lot of Snapdragon based phones so my choice will be that brand. Now check for Battery capacity That is which one has more of it like 4000 MAh and 5000 MAh are quite good for lasting all day with heavy uses. Just do not go for less than 3000 MAh in recent times. Also remember the processor used in it and then check battery. The less the Nano-meter(np) the better and more the capacity the better.\n\n

    <string name="smartphone_ram_intro">

        What is ram?\n\n
Ram (Random Access Memory).It is called random access memory because it can be read and written at any point without needing to wait in the queue of process is the ultimate part of any compute capable machine that helps to load and execute task and specially, when you use a tons of apps in smartphone you get to know that how important it is for loading your apps. So, the knowledge about Ram is so much important when buying your smartphone.\n\n

    </string>

    <string name="smartphone_ram_why_important">

        Why is ram so important?\n\n
Ram is the to help processor load and execute task and for doing multiple task you need ram if you ran out of ram your smartphone will lag a lot you will find it not so smooth rather your task will hang a lot when you have less amount ram on your device.\n\n



    </string>

    <string name="smartphone_ram_why_need_more_ram">

        Why we need more ram?\n\n

As the Modern world the technology is increasing and our daily necessary also getting more demanding like playing very high quality games, Shooting 4k videos, 4G, 5G, WIFI internet browsing, using multiple apps same time etc. need a lot of processing power and ram to access then and load them properly. So, day by day the importance of implementing more ram on smartphone is so vital.\n\n



    </string>


    <string name="smartphone_ram_how_much_enough">

        How much ram is enough?\n\n
It depends upon your need and use and OS (Operating System) as If you use android OS then you need more ram than IOS based Iphones as the platform and optimization are factors too when thinking about how much ram is proper. So, Android users need at least 3GB of ram to do daily task properly like games, shooting videos, watching 4k content, internet using with multiple tabs and for multitasking. But do not expect butter smooth performance in 3GB of ram now-a-days as its for average users and budget smartphone users. But if you want better performance than go for 4gb variant of that smartphone or if you have higher budget use 6gb of ram that is quite enough for any android phone at my writing time of January 2019 but this may change in future.\n\n
        Here we also have 8GB variant of Samsung Note 9, OnePlus 6 and 6T with 8GB of ram etc. But they are expensive if you go for 8 GB one so for most of budget people 3 GB or 4GB is quite good and for higher end users and more smooth performance and intensive multitasking use 6GB one.


    </string>


    <string name="smartphone_ram_optimization_android_vs_ios">

        Ram Optimization Differences:\n\n

        Ram behaves little differently in accordance with your OS and optimization. As in the previous section I told you guys that in android OS we need more ram but now let see why on IOS we do not need that much of ram on iphones, ipads etc. IOS has much better optimization than android so it does not require that much ram to operate smoothly. It can do all tasks and daily needs so smoothly in 2GB ram only that even 4GB ram android phones cannot give you. Like now Iphones are also using 4gb ram that compete with android 6GB and 8GB ram. IphoneX and Iphone Xs max do not have 8 GB of ram but it defeats all other 8GB android phones for its good apps and OS optimization. \n\n

    <string name="smartphone_ram_types">

        There are different types of ram modules:\n\n
        1. LPDDR3
        2. LPDDR4
        3. LPDDR4X


    </string>


    <string name="smartphone_ram_lpddrs">

        LPDDRs:\n\n
The LPDDR or Low Power DDR is also known as Mobile DDR or m-DDR. These are specially designed Double data rate Synchronous DRAM for the mobile smartphones and Tablet PCs. The essence of LPDDRs lies in the fact that they are design to consume low power at around 1.8 volts as compared to the 2.5 volts RAMs used in other devices.


    </string>


    <string name="smartphone_ram_lpddr4">

        The LPDDR4, as should be evident, is the fourth generation of LPDDR RAM technology. In essence, it can be considered to be the DDR4 alternative for the mobile devices. While DDR4 has already been used in high-end PCs and similar systems, their mobile equivalent the LPDDR4 finds a vital use in smartphones and tablets.\n\n
        The LPDDR4 brings ahead faster functionality and lower power consumption. The fundamental difference between then DDR4 RAM used in PCS and the LPDDR4 lies in the fact that they come with smaller bit bus. This helps in lower power consumption.\n\n
        The LPDDR4 improves the data rates by almost double when compared to the previous generations, the LPDDR3. You can get data rates as high as 3200Mb per sec with LPDDR4 as compared to the 1600 Mb per sec performance on the LPDDR3. The LPDDR3 had one channel, while the LPDDR4 opts for a two-channel design. It offers you 16 Bits per channel, thus providing you a total of 32 Bits. This can be helpful in lowering the power requirements of the core. The short data path ensures that the lower power consumption. This can be quite helpful in improving the operational speed and performance. The LPDDR4 offers a marginal improvement in the power consumption from 1.2 volts on LPDDR3 to 1.1 Volts on LPDDR4.\n\n


    </string>

    <string name="smartphone_ram_lpddr4x">

        LPDDR4X:\n\n


LPDDR4X is another fourth-generation Low Power DDR RAM developed for the mobile computing devices. In fact, there is not much of a difference between the LPDDR4 and LPDDR4X as such.\n\n

In fact, the LPDDR4X has been planned as a small optional upgrade to the LPDDR4 modules. The only difference between the LPDDR4 and LPDDR4X lies in the lower power consumption – still lower than that on the former. As we have already found above, the power consumption levels on LPDDR4 have been reduced marginally from the LPDDR3. This is further reduced with LPDDR4X.\n\n

        In essence, the LPDDR4X reduces the output driver power to achieve this. You will be able to reach around a 20 percent reduction in the power consumption for the memory system.\n\n


    </string>

    <string name="smartphone_ram_verdict">

        Final Verdict:\n\n

Well, the significant difference between the LPDDR4 and LPDDR4X lies in the fact that the latter reduces the power consumption requirements by almost 55 percent, bringing it down to 0.6 Volts. Of course, there are a few minor differentiations apart from that, but in most aspects, the two siblings remain almost identical and offer similar functionalities. Moreover, these RAM modules can be manufactured on smaller systems and thus help you in reducing the associated costs. We expect the LPDDR4X to be available on almost all future generations of processors.

    <string name="smartphone_rom_intro">

        What is Rom ?\n\n
ROM is Read Only Memory. As the name suggest you cannot write on this type of memory. But the data can be read and processed. The most Natural example of ROM is your smartphones internal storage that you get by default on a smartphone to store your media and files which is a portion of you ROM.\n\n



    </string>


    <string name="smartphone_rom_why_less_than_expected">

        Why we see less ROM than Expected ?\n\n
You might have noticed that out of 16 GB of a smartphone internal storage memory only 11 or 12 GB is available for you guys to use. That’s because the remaining amount of space is serves as ROM here. Your android OS and some preinstalled apps reside there.\n\n



    </string>


    <string name="smartphone_rom_why_need_more">

        Why we need more ROM ?\n\n

As you can see from the previous question we talked about some portion of ROM is used for your smartphones OS and preinstalled apps and services. So, you cannot expect to get full storage out of a smartphone. For 16GB ROM you get around 11GB, for 32GB ROM you get around 22GB so if you go for higher ROM capacity for smartphone you get more storage as internal storage for your phone. That will help you to store more photos, videos, songs, files and documents for you. It will also help you run your smartphone the more smoother and fluid as compared to less ROM phones. As you know that if you run out of storage you will feel sluggishness in using it.\n\n



    </string>


    <string name="smartphone_rom_how_much_enough">

        How much Rom is enough ?\n\n
It also depends on your use of smartphone. If you use it for like playing lots of HD games watch 1080P or 1440p movies you definitely need more ROM. Now if you are a basic user then you can go for at least 32GB of ROM as you can also have to check if your smartphone supports external SD card that you can add Storage for your media easily and cheaply. Now in 2019 you can get even 512GB ROM, 256GB and 128GB ROM smartphone that are really expensive but you may think its huge amount but simply not that case because if you shoot 4k videos, play HD games, taking thousands of high quality photos than definitely you need to have those high capacity of ROM smartphone. But I think in budget segment you will find tons of smartphones that has 64GB of ROM as default so if you are on budget you can have it. Before that Always check if there is SD card slot or not.\n\n



    </string>


    <string name="smartphone_rom_verdict">

        Final Verdict:\n\n
As you guys can now understand the importance of having More ROM as a default on your smartphone that holds all your apps, media, files etc. and for more greater performance you need more storage on your internal memory to run smooth and lag free. But if you want to cheaply increase your storage then check if it has SD card slot then if there is no SD card slot just buy at least 32GB or as my recommendation buy 64GB of ROM smartphone to maintain better performance of your smartphone. If you do not care for it you will get slower and shitty performance in your smartphone. If you have good budget always check 128GB, 256GB ROM phones.\n\n

    <string name="tv_basic_intro">
        Basics to know:\n\n
With the advancement of modern technology there are tons of things that have changed for electronics products and latest features that make peoples buy new product and yes for TV buying its essential to know the huge variety of types of technology, features, category and which one to choose from huge amount of options this tv blog will help you guide through every thing you must know to buy the best TV for your budget and taste. Let’s know about TV technology first and get rid of all the confusions.\n\n



    </string>


    <string name="tv_basic_display">
        Display of the TV:\n\n
The display of a tv primarily comprises of HDR, contrast, refresh rate, resolution and the type of display. Here is some of the basic details about these components of display.\n\n



    </string>


    <string name="tv_basic_hdr">

        HDR (High Dynamic Range):\n\n
HDR stands for High Dynamic Range. In simple term, you can say it is more Colors and finer picture quality while you are watching TV. However, HDR display works only when the content you want to watch is available in HD quality.\n\n



    </string>


    <string name="tv_basic_contrast">
        Contrast:\n\n
A TV with higher contrast ratio will have better display on its screen because you even get to see the finest details of picture on your screen. OLED TVs are considered the best when you are looking for a TV with high contrast ratio.\n\n



    </string>


    <string name="tv_basic_refresh_rate">

        Refresh Rate:\n\n
This refers to the number of times the image on your TV screen is replaced every second. It is measured in FPS or Hz. The higher the refresh rate of your TV, the better will be you viewing experience while you are watching your favorite sports or action movies.\n\n



    </string>


    <string name="tv_basic_resolution">

        Resolution:\n\n
The sharper the resolution, the better will be the clarity you get on the screen. On the basic of resolution, 3 Types of TVS are available-HD Ready, Full HD(FHD) and 4K or UHD (Ultra HD). HD Ready TVs have 1 million pixels and resolution is 1280*720 which is 720p HD screen.\n\n
FULL HD TVs are those having 1920*1080 resolution and they are quite good as it has 2 million pixels which is decent sharp for TV. Price starts around $500 or more.\n\n
Modern TVs having much higher 4k or UHD resolution like 3840 *2160 display resolution is very sharp to look at and it is quite expensive to buy around 800$ or more depending upon all the features and brands. It can get up to more than 3000$ dollar even.\n\n
There are also 8K 7680*4320 display which is crazy to have and not recommended as its very expensive and not all the content have 4k yet rather 8k is good for future proofing nothing else!\n\n



    </string>


    <string name="tv_display_types">

        Types of display (Display Type):\n\n
    On the basis of type of display, TVs are into 3 basic types-LED, QLED and OLED TVs. Here is the brief discussion of these 3 types of display to help you in understanding them better.\n\n



    </string>

    <string name="tv_display_lcd_panel">

        LCD/LED:\n\n

All major TV brands are still selling plenty of LCD-LED TVs. LCD (liquid crystal display) and LED (light-emitting diode) TVs are often thought of as competing concepts, but they actually refer to identical display technology. In an LCD TV, liquid crystals rotate polarized light, effectively acting as a light valve that illuminates all pixels simultaneously. Instead of the pixel-by-pixel lighting of OLED TVs, in a standard LCD TV all light comes from a big energy-guzzling backlight. The result is a uniform brightness, and relatively low contrast images.\n\n
If you watch in a completely black environment, you\’ll notice blotches and uneven brightness on the panel too, and a lack of shadow detail in dark areas of the screen. That said, images are usually very bright, and very colorful, and you can buy an LED TV in virtually any size you want. They\'re great value.\n\n
Pros of LCD or LED:\n\n

1. It\’s very affordable\n
2. Available in any Size\n
3. Bright and colorful\n\n


        Cons of LCD/LED:\n\n
1. Aging technology\n
2. narrow Viewing angle\n
3. Average contrast\n
4. Poor black level\n\n



    </string>

    <string name="tv_display_oled_panel">

        OLED:\n\n

Watching an OLED TV for the first time is genuinely a pure joy moment. So smooth, fluid, colourful and contrasty are the images that it\'s really hard to go back to your old LCD or plasma TV. Once you look into that beautiful OLED Display you will never like other Displays!\n\n
Almost as flat as wallpaper, organic light-emitting diode (OLED) is a breakthrough moment for TVs. Critically, it emits its own light, so the huge backlight used by most TVs isn’t there. As well as being slim, in an OLED display each pixel self-illuminates, so you can control images at an individual pixel level.\n\n
So, video that features both darkness and extreme brightness, such as a star-filled night sky, looks realistic. With unlimited contrast, it means the whitest whites and the darkest blacks – and everything in between. Expect eye-popping color, and, crucially, lightning-fast response times. There are downsides to OLED too though: it’s very expensive, and no one is quite sure how long panels will last.\n\n
Pros of OLED:\n\n
1. The slimmest TV TECH(2.57mm)\n
2. Self-Lighting pixels\n
3. More convincing blacks\n
4. Faster Refresh rates\n
5. Judder and Blur-free\n\n

Cons of OLED:\n\n
1. Only Found in 3 Screen Sizes: 55,65 and 77-inch\n
2. Muted Brightness (1000 nits)\n
3. Expensive\n\n



    </string>


    <string name="tv_display_qled_panel">

        QLED:\n\n
Another premium TV technology that\’s only recently gone on sale, QLED (quantum-dot light emitting diode) is very different to OLED. QLED panels are not self-emissive, instead lit by LEDs along the edge (just like an Edge LED-backlit LCD). The advantages of QLED TVs are that they use a quantum dot color filter and are capable of significantly higher brightness than OLED TVs. Cue eye-popping color, but slower response times than an OLED TV. However, the contrast and blacks aren\’t as good as OLED TVs.\n\n
Pros of QLED:\n\n
1. Excellent Whites\n
2. Ultra-bright (1500 nits)\n
3. Variety of Screen Sizes 49-88 inch\n\n


        Cons of QLED:\n\n
1. Not a slim as OLED (25.4mm)\n
2. Overly Bright\n
3. Slower Refresh Rates\n
4. Less convincing black than OLED\n\n



    </string>


    <string name="tv_display_recommendation">

        Recommendation:\n\n

        What you decide to buy largely comes down to price. Future innovations could turn that advice on its head, but for now, if you have money to burn and want the best, go for an OLED – no question. Want a brighter panel? Go for a QLED. If price is more of a concern and you don\'t need the blackest blacks around, then an LED-backlit LCD TV could well be the one you want – they might not have quite the same level of contrast, but depending on the manufacturer\'s technology they could come very close.\n\n


    </string>

    <string name="tv_sound_quality">

        Sound Quality of TV:\n\n
The sound of the TV is measured in watts where the higher the watts, the louder will be the maximum volume of your TV. The latest TV these days are equipped with pre-defines sound modes for gaming, sports, movies which automatically tune the volume of your TV viewing experience better.\n\n
The most preferred sound technology in TVs these days are Dolby Digital, DTS Premium and Harman Kardon. To enhance the sound quality of your TV, you can always attach speakers and soundbars to your TV.\n\n




    </string>


    <string name="tv_sound_bar">

        SOUND BAR:\n\n
Even the most expensive TVs have poor sound quality so in order to get rich sound from your great viewing experience use sound bars. Sound bar is so popular as for $300 or less they can significantly increase the sound quality and yet they are slim and look standard with your TVs.\n\n
Some TVs and sound bars also support Dolby Atmos which is a newer audio standard from Dolby that includes overhead sound for a fuller listening experience. While you can get the Atmos effect using in-ceiling speakers, many soundbars have Atmos audio processing and upward firing speakers built-in to create more realistic sounding audio that doesn\'t require the multiple speaker placement that you would have with 5.1 or 7.1 Surround Sound.\n\n
You never have to think about additional cable clutter. Nearly All the current TVs feature at least one HDMI Port with Audio Return Channel (ARC) capability. This standard HDMI feature provides lets you use HDMI as both an input and audio output, letting you not only send audio to the TV from external media devices, but also out to your sound bar. That ARC connection means that you get great sound for all your devices, with no special receiver needed.\n\n

    <string name="tv_screen_size_optimization">

        Screen Size of TV:\n\n
Both viewing distance and screen size are important factors that determine the picture quality that you are able to enjoy on your TV. The screen size of TV is measured diagonally. If you are confused about what screen size will be idea for your desired TV location, here are some tips that will help you out.\n\n
Measure the distance between the place where you will be sitting to watch TV and the wall where you want to affix your TV. Depending on that, here is the right screen size guide for you.\n\n\n

              Distance---------------------------ideal Screen Size

               5-6 fit						        32 inches

               6-9 fit		                        40-45 inches

    <string name="desktop_mouse_design_intro">

        There are lot of people who like mouse that looks gorgeous, stylish, good build and that has RGB lighting on it. It makes perfect sense for them to buy better looking mouse.\n\n



    </string>

    <string name="desktop_mouse_design_size">

        SIZE \n\n

        The first characteristic to consider is a mouse’s size. Mice that are intended to be portable tend to be smaller, and mice that are meant to sit on a desk tend to be larger. That’s perfectly logical, of course. Which is better for you comes down to the size of your hands – someone with smaller hands might choose a portable mouse just for its smaller dimensions and to user preference.\n\n






    </string>


    <string name="desktop_mouse_design_ergonomics">

        ERGONOMICS\n\n

Ergonomic mice, or those that are designed to reduce hand and wrist strain, are usually on the large end of the spectrum. They tend to conform to the hand, and they coax users into holding their fingers, hands, and wrists at angles that allow for more comfortable long-term mousing sessions. They’re also usually made for right-handed users but unfortunately, a much smaller number of mice are designed specifically for lefties.




    </string>


    <string name="desktop_mouse_design_grip">

        GRIP\n\n


One differentiating feature is a mouse\’s style of grip. There are three common grip types: palm, claw, and fingertip.\n\n

        Some mice, usually larger models, have a design optimized for laying your palm across the top and pushing the most around with the entire hand. Other, typically smaller mice use designs aimed at a fingertip grip, where the user grasps the mouse with the fingertips to guide it. And yet other, narrower mice are designed such that the palm rests on the back of the mouse and the fingers are most comfortable resting on top, forming a claw.\n\n

        Which grip works best for you comes down to personal preference, as well as your desired mouse size and shape.\n\n






    </string>


    <string name="desktop_mouse_design_buttons_dial">

        BUTTONS AND DIAL\n\n

Most mice have at least two buttons, commonly referred to as the left and right buttons. Most operating systems assign the left button to primary actions like selecting objects and clicking on-screen items, and the right button to secondary actions like opening menus. The main exception is Apple’s line of mice, which have a single button and use various tricks to emulate a right button click as necessary.\n\n

        Then, more complex mice are available that include additional buttons on the top, side buttons for accessing various special actions, and wheels that scroll and perform other actions. In many cases, these multi-button mice have special software that allows the buttons and wheels to be customized and remapped, enabling a wide range of individualized functionality.\n\n




    </string>


    <string name="desktop_mouse_design_lighting">


LIGHTING\n\n


LED lights are another feature, primarily found on gaming mice. They add some additional flair, as well as feedback during gaming systems. Usually, such mice come with software that can customize the lighting and match it with a user\’s installed games.\n\n



    </string>


    <string name="desktop_mouse_dpi_explanation">

        DPI\n\n

        Mouse sensitivity is measured in Dots per Inch (DPI for short) or Counts per Inch (CPI). The higher the DPI is, the faster the mouse movement on the screen is. Likewise, the higher the DPI is, the less physical distance you need to move the mouse. So, if you want to save yourself the effort and make smaller hand movements, choose a mouse with a higher DPI.\n\n

        However, there is another side of the coin. You need to have a very steady hand and make very accurate cursor movements. To sum up, if you make mostly fast sweeping movements over a large area, you need a mouse with lower DPI. If you make precise movements over a smaller area, you have to look for a mouse with higher DPI.\n\n


        Depending on the genre you prefer, the DPI may or may not be important. In FPS, where accuracy is of critical importance, the DPI does matter. Higher DPI is not always better.\n\n

        1. Most normal users don’t need to worry about DPI at all\n\n
2. Higher DPI is great for high-resolution display or multi-monitor setups. It enables you to traverse the screen quicker.\n\n
3. For gaming, high DPI allows you to act and react more quickly. Lower DPI gives you greater control and precision.\n\n
4. Gamer need a mouse with adjustable DPI settings.\n\n
5. For Photoshop or other apps that need a high level of precision they need lower DPI mouse.\n\n


    </string>






    <string name="desktop_mouse_dpi_recommendation">

        Recommendation\n\n

        Good gamer mice usually allow you to increase the DPI to at least 5000. You may stumble upon rodents featuring the staggering 12,000 DPI, although I personally do not know a gamer who uses more than 3000 DPI. It takes some time to find a sweet spot and adjust the DPI to your playing technique.\n\n

Last but not least, you\’d better settle for a mouse that allows you to adjust the DPI on-the-fly, so that you can switch to a low DPI for a precise headshot and increase it to strafe enemies.\n\n



    </string>



    <string name="desktop_mouse_dpi_polling_rate">

       Polling Rate\n\n

        The polling rate refers to how many times the mouse is reporting its current position to the computer. The polling rate is measured in Hz and it has a major bearing on your rodent\’s performance.\n\n
If you use Windows OS, the default polling rate is 125Hz, which means the computer receives an update for the position of the mouse pointer once per every 8ms. The faster the polling rate is, the more accurately the cursor is resolved on the screen. That example was just illustrative, though.\n\n

For competitive gaming, you need a mouse offering no less than 500Hz polling rate (2ms). The best gamer mice come with a 1000Hz polling rate or 1ms, but the difference between 1ms and 2 ms is negligible.\n\n




    </string>


    <string name="desktop_mouse_durability">

        DURABILITY\n\n

        If you are buying a mouse then you must be careful of the durability issues of that mouse and how long time you want to use, which purpose you will use mouse for it depends on these factors.\n\n
Professional Gamers must have to buy the most durable mouse as they play shooting, action, adventure game, competitive games that need a lot of mouse click and it puts mouse in huge pressure. So, cheap quality mouse which is rated 1M click or anything below 20M click is not proper for them at all.\n\n
Buy mouse which is rated at least 20M (Million) click or 50M click if your budget is higher because they are more durable, stable, accurate and optimized for professional gamers.\n\n


    </string>

    <string name="desktop_mouse_types_intro">

        TYPES OF MOUSE\n\n

        Mouse are of various types and we categorized them by different technology, purpose, look, quality, customizability and comfort etc. segments:\n\n

1. Wired vs. Wireless\n
2. Laser or Optical\n
3. Ergonomics\n
4. Full sized / Travel sized\n
5. Gaming / general\n\n



    </string>




    <string name="desktop_mouse_types_wire_vs_wireless">

        WIRED VS. WIRELESS\n\n

There are several reasons to choose either of them as both have advantages and disadvantages. Let’s check them side by side:\n\n


Wired Advantages:\n\n

1. It does not need to charge\n
2. Generally Cheaper.\n
3. Better input latency!\n
4. Faster response\n\n

Wired Dis-advantages:\n\n

1. It has cables.\n
2. Cannot use it from long range\n

Wireless Advantages:\n\n

1. Can be used from long range\n
2. It does not have cables\n
3. Just use in anywhere!\n

Wireless Disadvantages:\n\n
1. Need to charge it\n
2. Expensive\n
3. Poor latency input\n
4. Slower response than wired\n

WIRELESS MICE ARE IMPROVED\n\n

We know that wireless mouse needs to charge and the poor input latency issues happen which hurts the gamer most as gamers prefer absolute consistency and reliability that comes with wired mouse.

But situation is now changing as the wireless technology is improving a lot and now lots of good quality wireless mouse out there which are almost as quick and responsive as original wired mouse! We need to think about the benefit of it as it can be used in any places in the room without the wire and it looks clean and convenient too.



    </string>


    <string name="desktop_mouse_types_bluetooth_wireless">

         Bluetooth Is Best for Wireless Mice\n\n

When buying a wireless mouse, your choice is between radio frequency (RF) or Bluetooth models. RF mice may be slightly more responsive, and are much easier to set up simply plug in the dongle that comes with it.\n\n
The downside is that the dongle hogs one of your USB ports, and is near-impossible to replace if you lose it. RF devices are also more prone to interference.\n\n
Bluetooth is more convenient. It won’t use a precious USB port, and battery life can easily run to a year or two. It’s also a lot easier to share a single mouse between several computers.\n\n
        Setting up a Bluetooth mouse requires a few extra steps, and you have to wait for it to reconnect when you boot or wake your computer. But for the most part, Bluetooth is now the way to go.\n\n



    </string>


    <string name="desktop_mouse_types_laser_vs_optical">

        LASER VS OPTICAL\n\n

        The sensor is the heart of and soul of a good mouse. There are a lot of debate The Laser vs. Optic mouse for so many years. Today we will get complete knowledge about those two technologies in detail.\n\n

Laser and Optical both are actually the variation of same technology. The main difference is that Optical mouse uses LED to reflect off the below surface, while a laser mouse uses a LASER to track movement.\n\n


Advantages are more on LASER mouse like:\n\n

1. Laser mouse are sensitive\n
2. Work on various surfaces\n
3. Work on glass\n
4. Has Higher DPI (smoother)\n
5. Better Acceleration\n
6. it is more accurate and precise\n

Disadvantage of Laser mouse is rare like:\n\n

They can move across the screen quicker due to higher DPI ratings and this causes some problems. This is where the mouse pointer travels further when you move the mouse quickly than it does when you move it slowly. Many gamer’s hate this. So, many of them sometimes prefer the steadiness of an optical mouse over the increased precision of a laser one.\n\n


Advantage of Optical mouse is less it only works better in smooth surface and when you have good mouse pad and large mouse pads is very helpful if you buy Optical mouse as it does not work on dust and glass etc. and many other rough surfaces properly.\n\n


Disadvantage of Optical mouse:\n\n


1. It needs good surface\n
2. Less accurate\n
3. Poor precision rate\n
4. Less smooth\n
5. Poor DPI etc.\n\n

    <string name="desktop_mouse_types_ergonomics">

        ERGONOMICS\n\n

        One of the most important factors of any computer peripheral is how comfortable it is to use for longer period of time. It is very important for the people who work in office and have to use mouse all time and for gamers as well who play game for longer time.\n\n

How comfortable they are depended on many conditions:\n\n

1. Grip you prefer\n
2. Size of mouse\n
3. Shape of mouse\n
4. how you hold mouse\n

Based on this you choose which one you are comfortable with you hand position.\n\n

Ergonomics in mice are important because they can help prevent repetitive stress injuries. Research before buying that this mouse it comfortable for me to hold than others and that is important for any buyer to consider.\n\n
Ergonomics mice are designed to fit properly in your hand in natural way that helps to reduce strain on your finger and wrist. They also have extra buttons within easy reach of your digit.\n\n






    </string>



    <string name="desktop_mouse_types_fullsize_vs_travelsize">

        FULL-SIZED VS TRAVEL SIZED \n\n

This category is exactly what it sounds like. Although there is no universal sizing among manufacturers, many mice come in two different sizes: full or travel.\n\n
 Even if you never plan to remove your mouse from its home, travel mice can often be more comfortable for people with smaller hands. Likewise, a road warrior may want to stick with a full-sized device because ill-fitting mice can cause discomfort.\n\n





    </string>



    <string name="desktop_mouse_types_general_vs_gaming">

        GAMING / GENERAL USE\n\n

While buying a mouse as a user we know what purpose we are buying. If you want a complete package that can serve all needs in our budget range and that can be used in office work, gaming, editing, graphics design work etc. then we choose a mouse in general purpose mouse. They are good for normal works like:\n\n


1. Office work\n
2. Normal Editing\n
3. Light Drawing\n

They are balanced in every department but not best in all sectors. You can buy those quite cheap compared to high quality Gaming mouse.\n\n

But there are lot of people who want the most accurate and reliable performer they choose expensive options that is suitable for their need only like gaming purpose. Gamers need good quality mouse with better build, nice design, comfortable to hold longer time, accurate, fast response etc. are part of good gaming mouse. They are amazing in many departments like:\n\n


1. Long time Gaming\n
2. Proper Editing\n
3. Perfect drawing\n
4. Accurate Graphics work\n
5. Comfortable to hold\n\n
